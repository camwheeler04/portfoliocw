     About Me!

<h2> Who Am I?
     </h2>

     <p>  Hi , My name is Cameron Wheeler and I play several sports. The sports I play consist of Basketball, Softball , Volleyball and Cross Country. These sports are the things I use to keep my mind off of the real world issues.The sport I will be focusing on is Basketball. I have been playing this amazing sport since the sixth grade and I have been enjoying it ever since. Considering the fact that at first i didn't have any interest in it and never thought I would be in love with it.

 </p>
<h2> What I do in my leisure time?
</h2>
<p> During my leisure time I love to play with my basketball team against other teams. This has been something that entertained me for a while now. Every new team I go to I have so much fun and we make a great time out of anything.

</p>

<h2> What is my plan?
</h2>
<p> I desire in making change in the community and making the world a better place to the best of my ability. I can help my community by becoming a nurse and help the people that will need my services. Another way is becoming a Information Technologist and creating websites for companies that my comunity or even people outside of my community can use.
